            <h2>Decription</h2>
            <p>This is one of my favourite vegan mashed potatoes recipes. It's nutritious and delicious!</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds potatoes, Yukon Gold or Russet</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, sliced, optional</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons vegan butter, softened, or extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1/2 - 3/4 cup unsweetened non-dairy milk</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes (2.5 cm), then transfer to a large pot full of cold water along with the garlic (if using).</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil, then low the heat to medium-high and cook uncovered for 15-20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender.</li>
                <li>Drain the potatoes and garlic well and return them to the pot.</li>
                <li>Add the vegan butter and the salt, and mash them using a potato masher or a fork until well combined.</li>
                <li>Heat the milk on the stovetop (or in the microwave) until warm.</li>
                <li>Finally, pour in the milk a little at a time until it's fully incorporated. Add more or less milk, depending on the consistency you're looking for.</li>
                <li>Serve your vegan mashed potatoes immediately with some vegan gravy, or a giant scoop of vegan butter, or just by themselves.</li>
            </ol>
