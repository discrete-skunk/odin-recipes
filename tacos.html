        <h2>Decription</h2>
        <p>This is one of my favourite vegan tacos recipes. It's nutritious and delicious!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6-8 white or yellow corn tortillas</li>
            <li>Avocado or grape seed oil</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>Ground cumin</li>
            <li>Ground chili powder</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced pineapple</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced tomato</li>
            <li>3 tbsp diced jalapeno</li>
            <li>3 tbsp diced red onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
            <li>1 pinch each salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and get out two baking sheets as well as a few mini cupcake liners if you have them. As long as you have either cupcake liners or two baking sheets, you can make this method work!</li>
            <li>Lightly brush tortillas on both sides with oil and sprinkle with salt. Then stack two baking sheets and lift one side. Tuck as many tortillas as will fit comfortably on the edge. Then lower the top baking sheet and fold the tortilla over the top so it forms a shell shape. In addition or alternatively, simply arrange tortillas on a baking sheet, fold over, and slide two mini cupcake liners inside the shell so it creates an opening. See photo for guidance!</li>
            <li>Bake 10-20 minutes (will depend on brand and freshness) until light brown and crisp. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>While tortillas are baking, add pinto beans to a small pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat, then lower heat to low and simmer until serving. Taste and season â€“ I suggest ground cumin, chili powder, and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Lastly, prepare pineapple salsa by adding all ingredients to a small bowl and tossing to coat. Taste and adjust flavors as needed, adding more salt for flavor balance, lime for acidity, or pineapple for sweetness. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Once tacos are done baking and slightly cooled, fill generously with pinto beans, pineapple, and other toppings. I went with avocado, hot sauce, and cilantro.</li>
            <li>The shells are best when fresh. I would only make as many as you want to enjoy immediately as they tend to lose their crispiness when stored.</li>
        </ol>
